## Assignment 3 
## Few people/groups present
## Our solution
## Due Friday (PR)
## Where are we in project (ie. how progressing to end it)
## Housekeeping

## Between Class 3 & Class 4

> - async material in Week 3 syllabus
> - Readings in Week 3 syllabus
> - Assignment 03


## Class 4

> - Review Assignment 03, questions, where did you hit a wall?
> - Some lectur-ish stuff/activities on Assignment 04/Week 4 async topic
> - Review Query Project (spans Assignments 2-5)
> - Preview, discussion, do contentprep activities for Assignment 04 (refining and answering your project questions)
> - Final Assignment 03 due on Friday

> - Readings in Week 4 syllabus
> - Assignment 04


# Highlight async Ideas/Concepts
## Where are we in the pipeline

## Immutability

- Prefer raw data
- Better able to reverse your process
- Keep your data (HDFS, cold storage in AWS etc)
- Kafka - kappa architecture, storing raw events in message queue 
  * unpack why that's different from usual - activity?

::: notes
- What are raw data
- How can you tell you have it?

# Activities from async content

## Athena & AWS cli tool (aws)

::: notes
- watched video on it week 3 async
:::

## aggregating queries
- Recalculate vs
- Precompute and warehouse
- Expense
- 

::: notes
- watched video on it week 3 async
- can we do it with hdfs?
- *** With the query project - do you want to precompute or recalculate? how to do both (have precompute but not recalculate) with sql?
think through following logic of pros & cons in videos, for making recommendations for GoBike

## Big Ideas & New Topic Activities

## Jupyter Notebooks

- what to do to get started
- some viz 

::: notes
run it in the container again (like I do on elias? on fwf?)
