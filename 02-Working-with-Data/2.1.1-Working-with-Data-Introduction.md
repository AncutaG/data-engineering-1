# Why Do I Care?
##

<div class="notes">
- Working with data on a daily basis:
- How do you actually interact with that?
- How do you source, deal with these data?
- What sort of tools will you be using?
</div>

## 

"I emailed you the data... take a look and see what you think"

<div class="notes">
boss emails you some random csv file

or worse, xls
</div>

##

"I shared it in dropbox..."

<div class="notes">
coworker slacks you a dropbox or s3 bucket url

take an ordinary file and share it with you and you're left with dealing with a lot of issues with that file
</div>

## 

"Have Julie get you access to the marketing database... just tell her I said it's ok"

<div class="notes">
get you an account on a DB (or central FS solution)

You'd think there would be a nice guide around somewhere - often not.
</div>

## 

"Just google around for an API that'll give you what you need for that analysis..."

<div class="notes">
augmenting data
</div>

## 

..._Now_ What?

<div class="notes">
- When someone gets you a data file, 
- what sorts of back of the envelope calcs do you do?
- Is this a big data file?
- Is it from an hdfs store and you can't actually move it anywhere, need to deal with analysis in place?
- Or is it just a csv or tsv?
[What kinds of data are in it?]
</div>


# Agenda

- Data about data
- Tools

<div class="notes">
This series will cover two things:

- practical metadata

- tools you can use to extract that metadata

- Let's be clear, this is not the end all productionized analysis of a dataset -
- it's getting your feet wet, getting a feel for what that dataset is about.

</div>

# Data
##

##

- Format
- Schema / Types
- Count
- Range
- ...

<div class="notes">
- FORMATS, 
- stored as json, excel etc
- these are text formats, what else?
- what about highly optimized queriable data formats like Avro or parquet? (columnar - column centric formats - binary data formats)

- TYPES
- when you get a csv file, often there's a choice to put a header file. 
- Often you can infer what data types, numbers? strings, aka words, etc.
- if you have that great, if you don't you'll have to work a little harder at that
- we'll deal with what these things mean, deal with schema 

- COUNT
- how much is there
- how many rows are there?

- RANGES
- how large is it? 
- for a given field what are the ranges of the values in this dataset

- It's often (always) useful to get a cursory glance at the dataset to get a feel for how to move forward.

- We're going to show some examples now in a few screen casts.
