## Big Ideas

## Business Decisions

- All about the business

- Data-Driven Business Decisions ...are queries


<div class="notes">
in order for business decisions to be based on data, you have to be able to interact with the data.
business requirements get encoded as queries of data
</div>

## Translation

- SQL queries are really pretty easy
- How to get to the queries from the questions, sometimes not so much

## Query Project

- In the Query Project, you will get practice with SQL while learning about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery. You'll answer business-driven questions using public datasets housed in GCP. To give you experience with different ways to use those datasets, you will use the web UI (BiqQuery) and the command-line tools, and work with them in jupyter notebooks.

- We will be using the Bay Area Bike Share Trips Data (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/bay-bike-share). 

## Problem Statement
- You're a data scientist at Ford GoBike (https://www.fordgobike.com/), the company running Bay Area Bikeshare. You are trying to increase ridership, and you want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so. What deals do you offer though? Currently, your company has three options: a flat price for a single one-way trip, a day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24 hours and an annual membership. 

## Questions

- Through this project, you will answer these questions: 
  * What are the 5 most popular trips that you would call "commuter trips"?
  * What are your recommendations for offers (justify based on your findings)?

## Querying Data

## Get Going: Google account

- Go to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/
- Click on "Try it Free"
- It asks for credit card, but you get $300 free and it does not autorenew after the $300 credit is used, so go ahead 
(OR CHANGE THIS IF SOME SORT OF OTHER ACCESS INFO)
