# Tools
##

##

- The Command Line
- Jupyter
- Excel
- IDEs
- Spark/Impala/Beeline/HBase/DB Shell
- REPLs
- Other Exploratory Environments

#
## The Command Line

<div class="notes">
surprise!  what we've been doing
</div>

## The Command Line - pros

- flexible
- powerful
- everywhere
- quick-n-dirty

## The Command Line - cons

- steep learning curve
- too flexible?
- not inherently scalable

#
## Jupyter Notebooks

<div class="notes">
notebooks are great for data exploration.

This is where you will likely spend most of your working
days as a data scientist

excellent way to take things to the next level.

don't forget zeppelin!
</div>

## Jupyter Notebooks - pros

- flexible
- powerful
- real programming languages
- collaborative

## Jupyter Notebooks - cons

- not always available
- not inherently scalable
- requires programming expertise

#
## Shells

<div class="notes">
spark / pyspark
impala
beeline
hbase
etc

maybe even mention ipython here?
</div>


# Summary

- Data about data
- Tools

<div class="notes">
We covered two things:

- practical metadata

- tools you can use to extract that metadata

We saw some of the power of the command line in our examples
and associated activities.

Data exploration is really important, so we'll
revisit all of this material in greater detail
using various different tools throughout the course.
