# Entities

- User
- Product
- Address

<div class="notes">
- Let's talk aobut relations in RDBs
- consider a case where we have the Entities we talked about last time, 
- say an e commerce site where we're shipping things to users
</div>


#
## "has-one"

A User has a shipping address

<div class="notes">
A User has a shipping address
</div>


## embed

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-embed.svg)

<div class="notes">
- how can we implement that in the db?
- One straightforward way is to embed the `address` inside of the `user` table
</div>


## relate

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-hone.svg)


<div class="notes">
- Another way to do that is through a relation to another table. 
- _relate_ the `address` inside of the `user` table
- We say "A User _has-one_ Address"
- or equivalently "An Address _belongs-to_ one User"
- We call `user_id` here a "Foreign Key"
</div>


#
## "has-many"

If a User can have _many_ Addresses..l

<div class="notes">
- If that's a has one relationship, how do we deal with
a "has-many" relationship?
- multiple shipping adresses over time, eg parent cann have many children
- the way to deal with this say adding multiple columns, the embedding technique starts to fail.
</div>


## "has-many"

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-hm.svg)

<div class="notes">
- each `address` _belongs-to_ a single `user`
- again, `user_id` is a "Foreign Key"
</div>


#
## "has-and-belongs-to-many"

A User purchases many Products

&

A Product can be purchased by many Users

<div class="notes">
- There's another kind of relationship in RDBs
- It's very common but not as clear how to solve this always.
</div>


## "has-and-belongs-to-many"

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm.svg)

<div class="notes">
- called an association table
</div>


#
## Relations 

- has-a (`1:1`)
- has-many (`1:*`)
- has-and-belongs-to-many (`*:*`)

<div class="notes">
- And we saw how to solve that using foreign keys within RDBs
</div>
