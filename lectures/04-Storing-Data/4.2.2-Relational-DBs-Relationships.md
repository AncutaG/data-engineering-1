# Relations

"Things" can relate to other "things" in the database


#
## A "has-one" Relationship

A User has a shipping address


## embed

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-embed.svg)

<div class="notes">
embed the `address` inside of the `user` table
</div>


## relate

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-hone.svg)


<div class="notes">
or _relate_ the `address` inside of the `user` table

We say "A User _has-one_ Address"

or equivalently "An Address _belongs-to_ one User"

We call `user_id` here a "Foreign Key"
</div>


#
## A "has-many" Relationship

If a User can have _many_ Addresses...

##

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-hm.svg)

<div class="notes">
each `address` _belongs-to_ a single `user`

again, `user_id` is a "Foreign Key"
</div>


#
## A "has-and-belongs-to-many" Relation

A User purchases many Products

&

A Product can be purchased by many Users


##

<div class="notes">
uses an association table
</div>



## Relations

how these relationships are characterized has
a big impact on performance and ease-of-use
of the databases themselves
