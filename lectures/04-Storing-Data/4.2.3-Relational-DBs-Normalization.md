# Entities

- User
- Product
- Address


#
## A User habtm Products

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm.svg)

<div class="notes">
consider an association table
such as `user_products`

A User can purchase many products

A Product can be purchased by many users
</div>


#
## A User habtm Products

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-price.svg)

<div class="notes">
add information specific to that association

perhaps Mary purchased the bike on sale
</div>


#
## Purchases

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-purchases.svg)

<div class="notes">
of course we're leaving out a lot of stuff
like dates/times
</div>

#
## Transactions

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-purchases.svg)

<div class="notes">
This is a good format for the checkout
software to update purchases.  It only
has to update one table, `purchases`.
Purchases are atomic "transactions" and
it can _roll_ back any errors.
</div>

#
## Schema

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-purchases-and-addresses.svg)

<div class="notes">
Note this is a database "Schema" or a 
"Data Model" for a relational database.
</div>

#
## Analytics?

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-purchases-and-addresses.svg)

<div class="notes">
Now... do analytics off of this...

Count the total purchases of bikes by zipcode
it gets ugly... you're _joining_ a lot of tables
just for a simple calculation
</div>


#
## Reporting

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-purchases-report.svg)

<div class="notes">
It's often much easier to report off of a "view" of the
database and not the raw transactional tables themselves

Note that you often don't have full information (primary keys)
within the report.  This can cause problems in future analysis
</div>


#
## Normalization

<div class="notes">
two extreme representations of the same information
</div>


## Normalized

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-purchases-and-addresses.svg)

<div class="notes">
Optimized for on-line transaction processing (OLTP)
</div>


## Denormalized

![](4.2.2-rdb-relations-habtm-with-purchases-report.svg)

<div class="notes">
Optimized for reporting and analysis

reality is often either a happy medium somewhere in-between,
or two totally separate databases for different purposes
and some sort of an ETL process to go between them.
</div>
