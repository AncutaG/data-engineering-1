## What is a Relational Database?

- highly structured data store
- most common form of data storage
- use Structured Query Language (SQL)

<div class="notes">
Oracle's, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc
</div>

## Entities

the "things" you want to store
are represented as "tables" within a database


## primary keys


## indexes


## Relations

"Things" can relate to other "things" in the database

## hm

`A` _has-a_ `B`

`B` _belongs-to_ `A`


## foreign keys

`A` _has-many_ `B`s

`B` _belongs-to_ `A`


## habtm - association tables

`A` _has-and-belogs-to-many_ `B`




## Relations

how these relationships are characterized has
a big impact on performance and ease-of-use
of the databases themselves


## Normalization

two extremes:

- reporting
  highly denormalized


- oltp
  highly normalized


reality is often either a happy medium somewhere in-between,
or two totally separate databases for different purposes
and some sort of an ETL process to go between them.


## SQL
