## Transforming Data

first pass, etl & data munging, cloud, containers ()

-pipeline for context - transform section

you don't always get what you want (aka etl)
	you need to transform it
	not just where from / going, but how it's used
	

Hadoop
	distributed store
	hadoop etl (how analysis gets to the data)

cloud n containers - second pass (because how hadoop etl works requires schedulers)
  support distributed execution models
  intro to schedulers - how do you manage containers - spread the workload
  (YARN)
