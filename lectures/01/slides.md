## Why do I care?

Working as a data scientist, you eat, sleep, and breathe data!

Strive to be proficient with every aspect of data:

- kinds (device data, user data, ...)
- formats (avro, parquet, json, csv, ...)
- sources (wearables, mobile apps, web, ...)
- tools (jupyter, hadoop, kafka, spark, ...)
- ...


## Why do I care?

You'll also need to interact with

- other data scientists
- data engineers
- business analysts
- stakeholders / decision-makers
- users

## Organization

Business or Technology?

<div class="notes">
Ideally we'd present a business-centric approach to data engineering.  It's a critical
component.
[Explain why this is so important here?]

That's too hard here for a variety of reasons that'll become apparent throughout this course.

Instead, we'll compromise.  We'll use a technology-centric approach to organize the material
but we'll be sure to motivate all examples and activities with concrete business problems.
