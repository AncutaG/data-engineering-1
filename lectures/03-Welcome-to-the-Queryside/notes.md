Welcome to the modern datalab.

What do you need?

You need a safe platform to perform ad-hoc experimentation on data
The standard approach is that your experimentation will be productionized
over time and locked into a solid ETL pipeline.  We're moving away
from this approach and towards one that empowers the decision-makers
to do the experimentation directly.

How do do solve this?
