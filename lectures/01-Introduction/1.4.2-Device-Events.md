## A simple device event
<pre><code>
{
  "time_utc": "1457741907.959400112",
  "device_id": "c361-445b-b2f6-27f2eecfc217",
  "event_type": "environmental_info",
  "degrees_fahrenheit": "72",
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<div class="notes">

In reality they can differ in size,
encoding, transport, etc

but json is a good cross-section for
the purposes of our exercises
</div>
