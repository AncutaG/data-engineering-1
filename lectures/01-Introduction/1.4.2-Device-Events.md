# Simplified View

A world of event generators

<div class="notes">
- We're going to talk a lot about events in this class.
- I'd like you to take a second to think about the world around you
- from tvs, to  mobile devices, to weather stations, to self dirving cars
- We really can take a view of the world, almost matrix like, 
- in that there's a stream of events coming from everything all around you
</div>

# Device Events
##
<div class="notes">
Within that world, we're going to look at a group called device-events, a broad class of events
</div>

##
- location
- environment
- telemetry
- presence
- status (disk is full)
- ...

<div class="notes">
- location
- environment (humidity, temp)
- telemetry (precision information about location)
- presence (presence or absence of a signal)
- status (disk is full, my battery is almost dead)
- ...

We'll lump all of these into a category of device events.
</div>

# 
## A simple device event
<pre><code>
{
  "time_utc": "1457741907.959400112",
  "device_id": "c361-445b-b2f6-27f2eecfc217",
  "event_type": "environmental_info",
  "degrees_fahrenheit": "72",
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<div class="notes">
- Let's take a simple example of a device event
- This example is a log encoded in json
- A time stamp in Coordinated Universal Time
- An id for the device, globally unique identifier for the device
- A category of type for the event, here 'environmental_info'
- and a weather factor: temperature outside.

- You can imagine the variety of types of events and the kinds of things you would encode from that.

- When you start thinking of everything as an event generator, there's a difference, 
- between the thermometer and the bit that's sending up the events. - We're going to gloss over that here. That matters for say self-driving cars, but not for our purposes.
