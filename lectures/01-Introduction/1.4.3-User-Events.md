## Issues

##
- munging

<div class="notes">
- These can be downright ugly...
- adaptation/munging is often required
</div>


## 
- higher order events

<div class="notes">
- They're usually pretty straightforward. 
- Higher level composite events. Later we'll get to less well defined 'events' like 'user watches a television program' 
- but what we mean here are user events like "clicks button"

- Simply here, we have these log level like events that make up the more complicated kind.
</div>
