Strive to be proficient with every aspect of data:

- kinds (user data, device data, ...)
- formats (json, csv, avro, parquet, ...)
- sources (wearables, mobile apps, web, ...)
- tools (jupyter, hadoop, kafka, spark, ...)
- ...

You'll also interact with:

- other data scientists
- data engineers
- business analysts
- stakeholders / decision-makers
