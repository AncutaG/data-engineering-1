Business or Technology?

<div class="notes">
Ideally we'd present a business-centric approach to data engineering.  It's a critical
component.
[Explain why this is so important here?]

That's too hard here for a variety of reasons that'll become apparent throughout this course.

Instead, we'll compromise.  We'll use a technology-centric approach to organize the material
but we'll be sure to motivate all examples and activities with concrete business problems.
