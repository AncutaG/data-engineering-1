Plumbing streams of events

<div class="notes">
The _raw_ data for a large class of problems is streams or sequences of these
events

We'll assemble data science pipelines by connecting, munging, transforming, etc
these _event streams_ or event logs

We'll understand and take action based on primarily moving these around
to have enough of them in the right place and/or at the right time
for analysis
