<div class="notes">
- So, we covered types of events. 
- kind of events that when your business is based on a platform service (or a... egs.) these events don't happen once and go away.
- Important for your business is that these events are happening constantly. 
- Spotify ... 
- I'm generating a stream of events.

Solve business problems using data

<div class="notes">
- We talked about data science as solving problems using data.
- We'd like to refine that in light of our recent conversations about events themselves.

Understand streams of events related to our business


<div class="notes">
- The world around your business consists of a bunch of event streams 
- data science becomes understanding these streams of events related to your business.
- Whether they're device events or user events, 
- Capturing these streams of events, 
- storing these streams of events, 
- making sense out of these streams of events, 
- querying these streams of events, 
- These are the critical tasks of modern business.

The plumbing to _do_ data science

<div class="notes">
- Data engineering is the plumbing for data science, 
- so that means we're plumbing these streams of events.

Plumbing streams of events

<div class="notes">
- In a very literal sense, 
- The task of data engineering is often limited in scope to moving events around.
- Goal: you have enough of the right events in the right place at the right time to be able to make a decision.
</div>

<div class="notes">
- The _raw_ data for a large class of problems is streams or sequences of these events
- We'll assemble data science pipelines by ingesting, connecting, munging, transforming, etc- these _event streams_ or event logs
- We'll understand and take action based on primarily moving these around
- to have enough of them in the right place and/or at the right time for analysis
- The pipelines differ greatly depending on 
the volume
the fidelity
or the latency
of the decisions you need to make based on the event streams that are coming in. 
- ***the whole rest of this class will be, core of the course, is understanding these pipelines of event streams
- ****and 
the task of data engineering is to put the plumbing in place and build and manage the plumbing for the task of understanding and acting based on these streams of events.
