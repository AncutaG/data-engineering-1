## What Does a Data Scientist Actually Do?

<div class="notes">
There are lots of common misconceptions.

It's fun to walk through a few

## Are our solutions:

- correct?
- tractable?
- stable?
- robust?
- reproducible?
- comprehensible?
- relevant?
- efficient?
- performant?

## Data Science

- correctness
- cardinality
- comparisons to external models
- invariants / symmetry
- intuition / geometry / wetware

## Engineering

- connectivity
- correctness
- performance

## Community

- pipeline patterns and tools
- failure modes
- sanity checks
- testing patterns in DS pipelines
- creative uses of simian army for data
- caching patterns in DS pipelines
- other places to steal ideas from?
