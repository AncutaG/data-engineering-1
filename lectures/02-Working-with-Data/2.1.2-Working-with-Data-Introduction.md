# Why Do I Care?
##

<div class="notes">
Let's talk about.. actual datasets
</div>

## 

"I emailed you the data... take a look and see what you think"

<div class="notes">
boss emails you some random csv file

or worse, xls
</div>

##

"I shared it in dropbox..."

<div class="notes">
coworker slacks you a dropbox or s3 bucket url

usually world readable
</div>

## 

"Have Julie get you access to the marketing database... just tell her I said it's ok"

<div class="notes">
boss blows you off
</div>

## 

"Just google around for an API that'll give you what you need for that analysis..."

<div class="notes">
coworker blows you off too
</div>

..._Now_ What?


# Agenda

- Data about data
- Tools

<div class="notes">
This series will cover two things:

- practical metadata

- tools you can use to extract that metadata

Along the way, we'll get our feet wet in using the command line

Note that we'll gloss over some topics and allude to others here.
Don't worry, we'll cover _all_ of this material in a lot more
detail throughout the course.  This is meant to give you a feel
for the power of some of the tools involved.

# Data
##

##

- Format
- Schema / Types
- Count
- Presence
- Versioning
- Lineage
- ...

<div class="notes">
data about data

some of the many dimensions of metadata

the list keeps going...
- Durability
- Availability
- Access/Authorization
- Dependencies
- ...

and varies from dataset to dataset
</div>

#
## Format

- csv
- json
- avro
- ...

<div class="notes">
There're tons of file formats around

We'll go into more detail of lots of these formats later in the course

Focus for now on two common text-based formats: csv and json
</div>

## Format

- text (csv, tsv, json, xml, ...)
- binary (avro, parquet, xls, ...)

<div class="notes">
don't forget to consider zipped up text!
</div>

## Format

[screencast exploring file formats from the command-line]

<div class="notes">
show `cat views.json | jq -C . | more`

show `cat views.xml | xmllint --format - | pygmentize -l xml | more`
</div>

#
## Schema / Types

[screencast on schema exploration from the command-line]

<div class="notes">
show screencast example using jq
</div>


#
## Data Count

[screencast on counting content from the command-line]

<div class="notes">
show screencast example using jq, grep, and wc
</div>


#
## Presence

[screencast on content exploration from the command-line]

<div class="notes">
show screencast example using jq and grep
</div>


#
## Data Ranges

[screencast on finding ranges of types from the command-line]

<div class="notes">
show screencast example using jq, grep, uniq, and sort

how does this differ for really large datasets?
</div>


#
## Data Lineage

[screencast on data lineage from the command-line]

<div class="notes">
what is the history of fields in this dataset?

dunno really what to show here
</div>


#
## Data Access

[screencast on accessing data from the command-line]

<div class="notes">
does it contain private data?

should access to this be restricted?

if so, how will users access this dataset?

this feeds directly into activity02
</div>
