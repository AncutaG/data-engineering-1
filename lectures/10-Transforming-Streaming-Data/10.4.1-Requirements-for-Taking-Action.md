# Queries
##

## { data-background="images/classifying-with-state.svg" }

<div class="notes">
query data stores.

We're storing data in a format that makes for efficient queries.
</div>

## What do we need?

- Support structured query languages... they're common
- enable more advanced queries that include transformations
- enable queries against raw data
- enable query caching
- ... [todo]

## Common approach

BigQuery/Athena examples:

- Most popular bike routes by day of week?
- Return users -vs- new users
- Most popular destinations from each station?


# Action
##

## { data-background="images/classifying-with-state.svg" }

<div class="notes">
take action from stream
</div>

## What do we need?

- support low-latency decisions
- decoupled from storage, ingestion, transformation, etc
- stateless, yet have the ability to read state (update?)
- the ability to take action
- scaling
- ordering

## Common approach

[ kafka ]
[ spark streaming or lambda exmple here ]

<div class="notes">
Just-in-time or just-in-place couponing
</div>
