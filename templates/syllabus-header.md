# Course Description

Storing, managing, and processing datasets are foundational processes in data
science. This course introduces the fundamental knowledge and skills of data
engineering that are required to be effective as a data scientist. This course
focuses on the basics of data pipelines, data pipeline flows and associated
business use cases, and how organizations derive value from data and data
engineering.  As these fundamentals of data engineering are introduced,
learners will interact with data and data processes at various stages in the
pipeline, understand key data engineering tools and platforms, and use and
connect critical technologies through which one can construct storage and
processing architectures that underpin data science applications.
