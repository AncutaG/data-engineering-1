# The Goal
##

##

_Just enough_ data engineering

##

_Just enough_ data engineering to either:

- work effectively as a data scientist
- manage data science projects

<div class="notes">
A survey of the domain of Data Engineering
</div>


# We'll Cover
##

<div class="notes">
a range of material that should prepare you to go on to other courses in the program while moving you to the eventual goal of working as a data scientist.

With all these, we will get in lots more detail as we go.
</div>


## Sourcing and Ingesting Data

<div class="notes">
- Where do data come from? There are APIs, company databases, etc etc.
- Ingesting data is "Ok, it's out there in the ether, but how do I get it into my systems to work with?""
</div>

## Storing Data

- Types of Data Stores
- Data Models

<div class="notes">
- relational, nosql, hdfs, etc
- Schema
</div>

## Transforming Data

- Batch Processing
- Stream Processing

<div class="notes">
- These days this involves
- Batch, or a big lump of data at once, Processing, and 
- Stream, or as data flows in, Processing
</div>

## Querying Data

- Accessing
- Languages and Tools
- Planning
- Optimizing
- Productionalizing

<div class="notes">
- How do I access data?
- what languages and tools do I use
- How do I plan queries?
- How do I optimize queries?
- How do I productionalize queries so that they are automatic parts of my data pipeline?
</div>

## Understanding and Acting on Data

- Modeling
- Analyzing
- Tracking and Auditing
- Monitoring

<div class="notes">
This is your more traditional "data sciency" stuff
</div>

##

- Sourcing and Ingesting Data
- Storing Data
- Transforming Data
- Querying Data
- Understanding and Acting on Data

<div class="notes">
So, all together, this will get you...
Just enough coverage of this material to allow you to effectively perform.
</div>
