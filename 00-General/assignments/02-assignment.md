# Query Project Part I
## Assignment 02: Querying Data with BigQuery


### What is Google Cloud?
- Read: https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/

### Get Going

- Go to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/
- Click on "Try it Free"
- It asks for credit card, but you get $300 free and it does not autorenew after the $300 credit is used, so go ahead (OR CHANGE THIS IF SOME SORT OF OTHER ACCESS INFO)
- Now you will see the console screen. This is where you can manage everything for GCP
- Go to the menus on the left and scroll down to BigQuery
- Now go to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/bay-bike-share 
- Scroll down to "Go to Bay Area Bike Share Trips Dataset" (This will open a BQ working page.)

### Basics

### Some initial queries
- through console, pretty straightforward (https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/bigquery-public-data:san_francisco.bikeshare_trips?pli=1)
  *break down json view into original atomic events (brainstorm)
  *To make business decisions, we want to know the scope of the dataset
  *queries:*

### Three questions of your own
- BQ is a fully functional SQL environment
- So, use the SQL tutorial (https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
