## Misc / Unstated Goals
- just enough engineering
- tool proficiency


---

#
## Are our solutions:

- correct?
- tractable?
- stable?
- robust?
- reproducible?
- comprehensible?
- relevant?
- efficient?
- performant?

## Data Science

- correctness
- cardinality
- comparisons to external models
- invariants / symmetry
- intuition / geometry / wetware

## Engineering

- connectivity
- correctness
- performance

## Community

- pipeline patterns and tools
- failure modes
- sanity checks
- testing patterns in DS pipelines
- creative uses of simian army for data
- caching patterns in DS pipelines
- other places to steal ideas from?

missing bits atm:

- "Thinking about Data Systems"

- Modes of Failure to drive motivations for reliability, scalability, maintainability

- tensorflow and cloudML
- dataflow/Beam

- What does it mean to be in "production"

- simple MapReduce examples

- the infrastructure requirements for deep learning

- general structured -vs- unstructured as a way to think of data
  I generally don't like this but it's common

- Oh, overall _Scope_ of the course... i.e., "what this course is _not_ going to do"
  walk you through installations, etc etc
